# Request a database with SQL

<h1>I. Context</h1>

I did a consulting mission like BI Analyst in **Dat'Assur Habitation**, a B2C insurance company.

The CEO thought his company must stand out of the competition by resting on data to analyze his currents contracts portfolio and thus become **'Data-Driven'** (*that's to say decisions making must rest on largely on data*)

Under the New Technologies Director reponsability, my objective was to review insurance contracts prices to stand out of the competitors.

For that, I needed to realize an inventory of currents contracts, to try to standardize their pricing policy.

They wished customers pay according to their profiles, their locations, their status (tenant or owner) and their property types (house or appartment)
